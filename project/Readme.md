TODO:
- Use convex hull to get better coverage of the buoys and reduce the mask to about half of the short side of the smallest area rectangle that fits the contour.
- Show through console the time it takes to process each image frame to detect objects.
- Try to reduce image processing in object detection, to improve framerate.
